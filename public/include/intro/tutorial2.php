        Dear Participant,

    <p class="textSpan">
        Thank you for your interest in this study! The study will take about 30 minutes to complete. In return for your
        participation, you will receive a guaranteed payment of £3.50. Additionally, you will receive a payment that
        depends on your decisions in the study. This additional payment can be as high as £5.00. This study does not
        include any deception. This means that you will not be presented with ANY false information.

        This study consists of about 20 rounds. Each round starts with an effort task in which you will earn
        money based on your performance. After that, you receive information about the tax due based on your
        income, and you have to decide how much tax you pay. Afterwards, we provide you with a questionnaire
        including questions related to the study and some demographic information. Your additional  payment at
        the end of the study will be based on one of the rounds, which is randomly selected.

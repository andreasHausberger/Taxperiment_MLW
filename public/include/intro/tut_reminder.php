                Now, the actual experiment begins. <br>
                Please keep in mind: Your task in every round is deciding whether to pay or not to pay the required taxes.
                The relevant information will change in each round. There are ~20 rounds total. After the study ends,
                one round will be chosen at random, and paid in GBP.

        Dear Participant,
    </p>
    <p class="tutorialText">
        thank you for your interest in this study! <b>It is important that you only participate in this study using a
        laptop or desktop computer. Some of the questions will not work properly on a smartphone or tablet device. 
        Note that we will only pay participants who did use a laptop or desktop computer.</b>
    </p>

    <p class="tutorialText">
        The study will take about 30 minutes to complete. In return for your participation, you will receive a
        guaranteed payment of £3.00. Additionally, you will receive a payment that depends on your decisions in the
        study. This additional payment can be as high as £5.10. Thus, at the end of the study your total payment can 
        be as high as £8.10. This study does not include any deception. This means that you will not be presented 
        with ANY false information.
    </p>

    <p class="tutorialText">
        The present study consists of two parts. In the first part (the shorter part of the study) you will be presented
        with two simple questions and 10 lottery decisions. In the second part (the longer part of the study) you will
        be presented with about 20 financial decisions and a number of follow-up questions. Both parts will be
        introduced in detail before they start. All you need to know for now is that the decisions will involve
        financial aspects and use a currency we call ECU (experimental currency unit).
    </p>

    <p class="tutorialText">
        For each of the two parts, one of the financial decisions you take will be randomly drawn, converted from ECU to
        pounds, and paid to you as a bonus in addition to the guaranteed £3.00. You will receive more detailed
        information about this procedure in the following.
    </p>

    <p class="tutorialText">

    <h3>Aim of this Study</h3>
    <p class="tutorialText">
        This study is designed to gain insights into financial decision making. The study duration will
        be roughly 30 minutes. As compensation for your participation you will receive a guaranteed payment
        of £X. Additionally, you can earn between £Y and £Z, depending on your decisions in this study. 
    </p>

    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <p class="tutorialText">
        The present study consists of two parts. In the first part you will be presented with 10 decision pairs. 
        Your task will be to choose one option from each of the pairs. The second part of the study consists of 24 rounds. 
        You will make a financial decision in each round, i.e., a decision on tax payments. You will earn money 
        in both parts of the study. The size of the additional payment will depend on the decisions you make 
        during the study. For each of the two parts, one of the decisions will be randomly drawn and the respective
        outcome converted to Pounds and payed to you in addition to the guaranteed payment (£X). You will receive

<b> This is the last page. Thank you for your participation in this study.</b>

<br>
<p>
    Round <?php echo $randomRound ?> was randomly chosen.
    In this round, you earned a net income of <?php echo $income ?> ECU.
    This amounts to £ <?php echo $pound ?> (400 ECU = 1 £).
    Together with the show-up fee of £ 3.50, your payment for participating in this study is £ <?php echo ($pound + 3.50) ?>.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    The purpose of this study was to investigate how factors like social norms, audit probability, fine level, or tax rate influence tax honesty and which information is attended in making the decision whether to pay the tax due or to evade taxes.
